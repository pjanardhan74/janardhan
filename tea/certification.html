	<h1> CERTIFICATION </h1>
	<blockquote> Workers who pick and pack tea on plantations in developing countries can face harsh working conditions and may earn below the living wage.[115]</blockquote>

	<p> A number of bodies independently certify the production of tea. Tea from certified estates can be sold with a certification label on the pack. The most important certification schemes are Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade, UTZ Certified, and Organic,[citation needed] which also certify other crops such as coffee, cocoa and fruit. Rainforest Alliance certified tea is sold by Unilever brands Lipton and PG Tips in Western Europe, Australia and the US. Fairtrade certified tea is sold by a large number of suppliers around the world. UTZ Certified announced a partnership in 2008 with Sara Lee brand Pickwick tea.</p>

	<p> Production of organic tea has risen since its introduction in 1990 at Rembeng, Kondoli Tea Estate, Assam.[116] 6,000 tons of organic tea were sold in 1999.[117] About 75% of organic tea production is sold in France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</p>
